        Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather
        patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the
        solar cycle. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main
        driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like
        coal, oil and gas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a
        blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising
        temperatures.
      </p>
      <p class="shadow">
        Examples of greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change
        include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for
        driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land
        and forests can also release carbon dioxide. Landfills for garbage are a
        major source of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport,
        buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main emitters.

      <h3>
        Greenhouse gas concentrations are at their highest levels in 2 million
        years
      </h3>
      <p>
        And emissions continue to rise. As a result, the Earth is now about
        1.1°C warmer than it was in the late 1800s. The last decade (2011-2020)
        was the warmest on record.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people think climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But
        temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth
        is a system, where everything is connected, changes in one area can
        influence changes in all others.
      </p>
      <p>
        The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense
        droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding,
        melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.
