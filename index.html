            Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather
            patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the
            solar cycle. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main
            driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like
            coal, oil and gas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a
            blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising
            temperatures.
        </p>
        <p class="shadow">
            Examples of greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change
            include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for
            driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land
            and forests can also release carbon dioxide. Landfills for garbage are a
            major source of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport,
            buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main emitters.

            Greenhouse gas concentrations are at their highest levels in 2 million
            years
        </h3>
        <p>
            And emissions continue to rise. As a result, the Earth is now about
            1.1°C warmer than it was in the late 1800s. The last decade (2011-2020)
            was the warmest on record.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many people think climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But
            temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth
            is a system, where everything is connected, changes in one area can
            influence changes in all others.
        </p>
        <p>
            The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense
            droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding,
            melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.
